# Getting started with Canyon

Canyon is easy to drop into any CraftBukkit Beta 1.7.3 server.

::: warning
Canyon is currently incompatible with mod loaders such as ModLoaderMP, because they
overwrite classes modified by Canyon. Support for mod loaders is a work in progress.
:::

All you need to do is [download the latest build of Canyon](https://ci.canyonmodded.com/job/canyon/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/Canyon-Server/target/canyon-server.jar),
and launch it instead of CraftBukkit.
